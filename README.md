# Hong Kong Open Source Conference - R workshop

## Preparation

1. Install R on your computer

## R installation

### Linux

The easiest way is to your package management, may not be the most update version

```{bash}
sudo apt-get install r-base-dev
```

If you need the most updated version, there is a [deb source](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/README.html) for that.

### Mac OS X

Download the latest version of binary from any cran mirror, such as [r-studio](http://cran.rstudio.com/bin/macosx/).

Install the binary by double click it, and [there's no step three](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uXJlX50Lj8).

### Windows

I can only provide you with [this link](http://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/), limited support can be provided, sorry.
